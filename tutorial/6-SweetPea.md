# Trial Sequence: SweetPea

SweetPea is a domain-specific programming language built for the declarative specification of randomized experimental designs and the synthesis of trial sequences generated from those design specifications.

Here, we are going to use it to generate a counterbalanced sequence of S1 and S2 for a Weber-Fechner Experiment

## Installation

First install sweerpea:
```shell
pip install sweetpea
```

Head over to the [colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tYlXhedYp320IVYf96ae5yoG7EZJvkAu?usp=sharing).
Create a script `trial_sequence.py` in the research_hub and create a function there, that generates a trial_sequence
