# Stimulus/Event Sequence: SweetBean

SweetBean is an open-source domain-specific programming language in Python built for the declarative specification of stimuli sequences and the synthesis of JavaScript or HTML-files ready to be served as online experiments to the web.

Here, we are going to use it to generate a simple Weber-Fechner Experiment

## Installation

First install sweetbean:
```shell
pip install sweetbean
```

Head over to the [colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B0ulu5CWXAAWPLvS4IFgT7FpteLGq8fV?usp=sharing).
Create a script `stimulus_sequence.py` in the research_hub and create a function there, that generates a stimulus sequence
